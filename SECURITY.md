## Reporting a Vulnerability

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
If you discover a vulnerability in DLLPickle, please follow the process below:

1. Open a generic bug issue stating that you have discovered a potential vulnerability. Avoid sharing any specifics or technical details about the vulnerability in the public GitHub issue. Alternatively, you may email our security team at [security@day3bits.com](mailto:security@day3bits.com).
2. A repo owner will reach out to you to establish a private form of communication.
3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report. Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!
4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.

=======
If you discover a vulnerability in DLL Pickle, please follow the process below. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/SamErde/DLLPickle/security/advisories/new) form to report a security issue or vulnerability.

We will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial acknowledgement, we will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Our goal is to have all reports acknowledged within 7 days and resolved within 30 days. If you do not receive an acknowledgement, escalation may be sent to [security@day3bits.com](mailto:security@day3bits.com).
