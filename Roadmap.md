## vNext

- Add functions:
  - check latest version
  - import a specific version
  - verify MD5 hash with original source
- Add option to preload other common assemblies
- Add an option to inspect and preload the newest version of relevant assemblies only from the ones that are already included with installed modules on the current system.
- Add function to import specific sets of assemblies.
- Add function to clean up older versions of the DLL Pickle module (OR to import specific versions of the DLLs?)
