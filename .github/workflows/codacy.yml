# This workflow performs a Codacy security scan and integrates
# the results with GitHub's Advanced Security code scanning features.
#
# The scan runs on:
# - Pushes to the main branch
# - Pull requests against main
# - Weekly schedule (Sundays at 12:38 UTC)
#
# For Codacy security scan action usage and parameters:
