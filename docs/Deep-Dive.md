# Deep Dive

I hope to put this into my own words as I have more time, but for now, here is a podcast-style audio deep dive and a video that explains how DLL Pickle works.

> A look into a new PowerShell module called DLL Pickle, created to resolve common dependency conflicts experienced when managing multiple Microsoft services. This conflict, known as "DLL Hell" or the "DLL pickle," occurs because different modules, such as Az.Accounts and ExchangeOnlineManagement, rely on varying versions of the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and share the ".NET runtime's 'first-one-wins' loading behavior in a single session. The DLL Pickle module functions as a proactive dependency pre-loader by intentionally loading the newest, backward-compatible version of the MSAL DLLs first. By using this technique, which is described as programmatic assembly resolution, the module ensures that all subsequent services use the compatible, latest version of the authentication libraries, preventing session failures caused by incompatible older files.
